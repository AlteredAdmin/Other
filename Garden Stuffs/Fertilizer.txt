The Blood Meal application rate is 2 pounds per 100 square feet.

Your raised bed garden is 4 feet by 8 feet, which gives a total area of 32 square feet.

To calculate the amount of Blood Meal you need to apply:

Convert the area of your raised bed to the area per 100 square feet:
32 square feet ÷ 100 square feet = 0.32

Multiply the application rate by the area per 100 square feet:
2 pounds per 100 square feet x 0.32 = 0.64 pounds

Convert 0.64 pounds to ounces:
0.64 pounds x 16 ounces/pound = 10.24 ounces

Convert 0.64 pounds to cups (using a general conversion factor of 1.92 cups per pound):
0.64 pounds x 1.92 cups/pound ≈ 1.23 cups

Therefore, you would need to apply approximately 10.24 ounces or 1.23 cups of Blood Meal to your 4 foot by 8 foot raised bed garden.

=========================

If you have 25 gallons of soil and want to apply 2 tbsp of fertilizer per gallon of soil, you'll need to use a total of:

2 tablespoons/gallon x 25 gallons = 50 tablespoons of fertilizer

To convert tablespoons to another unit, we can use the following conversion:

1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons

Therefore, 50 tablespoons of fertilizer is equal to:

50 tablespoons x 3 teaspoons/tablespoon = 150 teaspoons of fertilizer

So, you'll need to use 150 teaspoons of fertilizer for your 25 gallons of soil.

To convert 150 teaspoons to cups, we can use the following conversion factor:

1 cup = 48 teaspoons

Therefore, we can divide the number of teaspoons by 48 to get the number of cups:

150 teaspoons / 48 teaspoons/cup = 3.125 cups

So, 150 teaspoons of fertilizer is equivalent to 3.125 cups of fertilizer.
