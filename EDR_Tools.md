Here are some notable open‚Äësource EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) tools you can run on Windows:

---

## üîç Host‚Äëbased EDR and HIDS

* **OSSEC** ‚Äì A mature host‚Äëbased intrusion detection system offering real‚Äëtime Windows registry and log file monitoring, file integrity checks, rootkit detection, active responses, and compliance support ([SANGFOR][1]).

* **Wazuh** ‚Äì Essentially an expanded OSSEC, it integrates SIEM/XDR features like threat hunting, malware detection, configuration auditing, and real-time response for both endpoints and cloud workloads ([Wazuh][2]).

* **Whids** ‚Äì A modern agent for Windows that collects artifact-rich telemetry via Sysmon, scalable to millions of events per day, with ATT\&CK integration and API support ([GitHub][3]).

* **Velociraptor** (from the ‚Äúawesome EDR‚Äù list) ‚Äì Enables declarative queries across Windows endpoints to collect system state, forensic artifacts, and hunt for anomalies ([GitHub][4]).

* **Fibratus** ‚Äì A lightweight tool for kernel tracing on Windows, useful for monitoring low‚Äëlevel system calls and capturing potential malicious behaviors ([GitHub][4]).

---

## üîÑ Cross‚Äëplatform EDR frameworks

* **osQuery** ‚Äì A versatile SQL-based engine that collects and logs file, process, network, and registry events across Windows, macOS, and Linux ([Heimdal Security][5]).

* **OpenEDR** (by Xcitium/Comodo) ‚Äì A full-fledged EDR platform supporting real-time detection, automated response (e.g., endpoint isolation), and deep telemetry with MITRE ATT\&CK mapping ([openedr.com][6]).

---

## üß™ Forensics & Malware Analysis

* **Cuckoo Sandbox** ‚Äì Sandboxes suspicious files and VMs to capture their behaviors, including API calls, memory and network flows‚Äîvaluable for enriching EDR pipelines ([Heimdal Security][5]).

* **GRR Rapid Response** ‚Äì Although focused on incident response, it supports live forensic collection and artifact retrieval from Windows hosts at scale ([Heimdal Security][5]).

---

## üåê Network‚Äëcentric tools

While not strictly EDR, they can supplement investigations:

* **Snort** ‚Äì A network intrusion detection/prevention system for monitoring traffic, useful in tandem with endpoint logging ([Heimdal Security][5], [Wikipedia][7]).

* **Zeek** ‚Äì A powerful network analysis engine that logs protocols and behaviors‚Äîoften used in network-focused EDR strategies ([GitHub][4]).

## üß≠ When choosing an open‚Äësource EDR, consider:

1. **Agent footprint & performance** (e.g. Whids is high‚Äëthroughput optimized).
2. **Telemetry depth** ‚Äì registry, file, process, kernel, memory.
3. **Automation & response** ‚Äì endpoint isolation, quarantine.
4. **Detection & granularity** ‚Äì integration with MITRE ATT\&CK.
5. **Ecosystem plugins** ‚Äì SIEM/XDR, orchestration, incident response tooling.
6. **Ease of deployment** ‚Äì centralized server vs lightweight agent.
